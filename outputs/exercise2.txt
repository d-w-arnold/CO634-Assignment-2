Full Decrypted Plaintext for Exercise 2: MAIDONLYWHOHADTOHOLDHEROWNAGAI

For the Java source code used in the completion of Exercise 2, please refer to the supporting file(s):

VigDecrypt.java
Decrypt.java (abstract class)
App.java (main method)

Description:

Using a Java implementation, for each character in the ciphertext, I would conduct the equivalent of a Caesar cipher transformation for each character in the ciphertext for the corresponding index in the provided key. Repeating the key so many times such that each character in the ciphertext corresponds to a character in the provided key. The method which does this is VigDecrypt.decryptPrivate(String key). For example:

Key: TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLES

FEAVCSEFAKIYBHKJPZWHZXVGOBFZHM (ciphertext)
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLESTESSOFTHE (key, repeated 1 and a bit times) (key repeats until each character in the ciphertext maps to a corresponding character in the key)
